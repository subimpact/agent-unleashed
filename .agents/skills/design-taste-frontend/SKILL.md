# tasteskill: Anti-Slop Frontend Skill

> Landing pages, portfolios, and redesigns. Not dashboards, not data tables, not multi-step product UI.
> Every rule below is **contextual**. None of it fires automatically. First read the brief, then pull only what fits.

## 0. BRIEF INFERENCE (Read the Room Before Anything Else)

Before touching code or tweaking dials, **infer what the user actually wants**. Most LLM design output is bad because the model jumps to a default aesthetic instead of reading the room.

### 0.A Read these signals first
1. **Page kind** - landing (SaaS / consumer / agency / event), portfolio (dev / designer / creative studio), redesign (preserve vs overhaul), editorial / blog.
2. **Vibe words** the user used - "minimalist", "calm", "Linear-style", "Awwwards", "brutalist", "premium consumer", "Apple-y", "playful", "serious B2B", "editorial", "agency-y", "glassy", "dark tech".
3. **Reference signals** - URLs they linked, screenshots they pasted, products they named, brands they're competing with.
4. **Audience** - B2B procurement panel vs. design-conscious consumer vs. recruiter scanning a portfolio. The audience picks the aesthetic, not your taste.
5. **Brand assets that already exist** - logo, color, type, photography.
6. **Quiet constraints** - accessibility-first audiences, public-sector, regulated industries, trust-first commerce.

### 0.B Output a one-line "Design Read" before generating
Before any code, state in one line: **"Reading this as: <page kind> for <audience>, with a <vibe> language, leaning toward <design system or aesthetic family>."**

### 0.C Anti-Default Discipline
Do not default to: AI-purple gradients, centered hero over dark mesh, three equal feature cards, generic glassmorphism on everything, infinite-loop micro-animations everywhere, Inter + slate-900.

## 1. THE THREE DIALS (Core Configuration)

* **`DESIGN_VARIANCE: 8`** - 1 = Perfect Symmetry, 10 = Artsy Chaos
* **`MOTION_INTENSITY: 6`** - 1 = Static, 10 = Cinematic / Physics
* **`VISUAL_DENSITY: 4`** - 1 = Art Gallery / Airy, 10 = Cockpit / Packed Data

**Baseline:** `8 / 6 / 4`.

| Signal | VARIANCE | MOTION | DENSITY |
|---|---|---|---|
| "minimalist / clean / calm / editorial / Linear-style" | 5-6 | 3-4 | 2-3 |
| "premium consumer / Apple-y / luxury / brand" | 7-8 | 5-7 | 3-4 |
| "playful / wild / Dribbble / Awwwards / experimental" | 9-10 | 8-10 | 3-4 |
| "landing page / portfolio / marketing site (default)" | 7-9 | 6-8 | 3-5 |
| "trust-first / public-sector / regulated / a11y-critical" | 3-4 | 2-3 | 4-5 |

## 2. DESIGN ENGINEERING DIRECTIVES

### 2.1 Typography
* **Display / Headlines:** Default `text-4xl md:text-6xl tracking-tighter leading-none`.
* **Body / Paragraphs:** Default `text-base text-gray-600 leading-relaxed max-w-[65ch]`.
* **Sans Font Choice:** Pick `Geist`, `Outfit`, `Cabinet Grotesk`, `Satoshi`, or brand-appropriate serif.
* **Serif Discipline:** Serif is discouraged as default unless brand explicitly calls for editorial/luxury.

### 2.2 Color Calibration
* Max 1 accent color. Saturation < 80% by default.
* **THE LILA RULE:** The "AI Purple / Blue glow" aesthetic is discouraged as default. Use neutral bases (Zinc / Slate / Stone) with high-contrast singular accents (Emerald, Electric Blue, Deep Rose, Burnt Orange).

### 2.3 Layout & Materiality
* **ANTI-CENTER BIAS:** Centered hero is avoided when `DESIGN_VARIANCE > 4`. Use split-screen (50/50), left-aligned content / right asset, or asymmetric space.
* **Hero Viewport Fit:** Hero must fit initial viewport (`min-h-[100dvh]`). Headline max 2 lines, subtext max 20 words.
* **Bento Rhythm:** Do not repeat identical card layouts. Vary composition: full-width rows, asymmetric tile sizes, vertical breaks.
* **Eyebrow Restraint:** Max 1 eyebrow label per 3 sections.
* **Real Social Proof:** Real company SVG marks from Simple Icons, not plain text names.
